        <description>
‚ÄãAt  Wakam, we are rapidly expanding our operations in the UK, and we're looking for a Head of Accounting & Tax to join our dynamic team. Our company is not your typical insurance organization; we're a tech-driven, innovative company that values performance, agility, and rapid execution.

This role comes with significant flexibility and the opportunity for remote work, making it an excellent fit for those who thrive in a fast-paced environment.

Establish Financial Operations in the UK: In this role, you will play a crucial part in setting up and structuring the finance activities in the UK, in alignment with what is being done at our Head Office in France.

Process Enhancement: Work on designing, streamlining and enhancing financial processes, while ensuring a smooth integration of the UK accounting function with the Head Office. This includes working closely with the teams in France and aligning with the UK's development strategy and regulatory requirements.

Monitoring the UK Financial Performance: Assist in giving visibility about our UK financial performance from an accounting point of view.
Direct Reporting: Report directly to the CFO UK and collaborate with the Head Office in a matrix, cross-functional structure.

Rigorous and Constructive: high degree of rigor and able to design a target operating model for running operations. This role involves working in a multicultural environment with the Head Office.

What we are looking for
Mindset compatibility with our ‚ÄòFree to Impact‚Äô culture:

Think big
Biased for action
Curious and eager to learn
Can say no and find solutions
Aims for the moon (but please don‚Äôt stick on the moon)
And above all: have fun working together ü§úü§õ !
Good to know
Wakam is not based on a hierarchy but on a methodology where everyone finds his role and knows his objectives.
With a flat hierarchical system and a highly collaborative operating model, Wakam is an extremely agile and transparent company.
Every last Friday of the month, it's Free.day at Wakam, a day without meetings to take a step aside and dedicate ourselves to skills sponsorship or other activities (because we are curious, I remind you).
Full-remote is a reality at Wakam (there is even one Wakamee who works from his sailing boat ‚õµ)
Last but not least : we are nice and we have fun! (you'll find out by yourself üòâ)
