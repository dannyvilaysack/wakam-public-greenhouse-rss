        Wakam is a European B2B2C insurer that designs white label insurance products for its partners (e-retailers, brokers and fintechs/insurtechs, etc.).
​
        Our insurance products have the particularity of being embedded in the products or services offered to the end-customer (for example, you take a self-service e-scooter, you are automatically insured). Wakam operates in 32 European countries with the majority of its turnover generated outside France.
​
        The company provides most of its products through API, and hosts white label insurance solutions via its Play&Plug technology platform. At Wakam we believe in the formula “for-profit & for good”. Since March 2021, we are a Mission-driven company, which means that our mission statement ‘Enabling transparent and impactful insurance’ is written in our bylaws.

We also create insurance products at cost for associations.

        A culture where everything is possible, where all ideas are taken into consideration, where everyone has an impact on the transformation of insurance! Hungry for freedom? Thirsty for autonomy? If you are adventurous and like challenges, then the Wakam adventure might be made for you!
​
        To support these products and accelerate our growth, Wakam has built a set of Digital Products and a Data Platform for integrating and storing data from distribution partners (insurance contracts, claims and payments), giving insights to our partners and supporting the various internal data use cases (Business Intelligence, Data Analytics, Data Science and Actuarial).

        <description>
​Wakam is a European B2B2C insurer that designs white label general insurance (GI) products for its partners (e-retailers, brokers and fintechs/insurtechs, ...). Our insurance solutions are embedded within the products or services offered to the end-customer.

Wakam operate in 32 countries across Europe with most of the revenues generated outside of France. Most of our products are delivered through API and hosts white label insurance solutions via our Play&Plug platform.

To meet these challenges, Wakam has built a technological platform called Play&Plug divided into several digital products (distributor portal, reinsurer portal, portal for internal businesses, API base, Policy Admin System on the Blockchain, Pricing Engine, etc.). Our team is in charge of the API Platform who allows our partners to distribute Wakam’s insurance products via multiple acquisition channels (websites, mobile applications, marketplaces, agregators…). Available APIs allows our partners to issue quotes to their prospects depending on their risk profile and then to follow the lifecycle of the contract after the subscription is recorded. Currently we develop a new API to do AML checks in order to comply with the regulation.

Wakam’s differentiation comes from its velocity to create new bespoke insurance products as well as quickly change pricing model of existing products to face new market conditions or risk profile of the portfolio. Thus one of the key mission is to speed up the time actuaries take to create and modify quote APIs without any help from IT.

The platform manages a 50 Million requests trafic each month. It is powered by a highly distributed and resilient architecture hosted on Azure. It is essential to track and commit SLA/SLO and at the same time to remain vigilant about our infrastructure budget.

 

Our culture? Free to impact.

A culture where everything is possible, where all ideas are taken into consideration, where everyone has an impact! Hungry for freedom? Thirsty for autonomy? If you are adventurous, then the Wakam adventure might be made for you!

 

✎ The Mission 
The team is looking for a new companion to help it achieve its objectives.

Your day-to-day role will be to participate, with the team, in the entire product development process, from understanding needs to obtaining feedback from partners and domain experts.

Given the sensitive scope of your work, you'll be focusing on the following aspects of delivery performance:

Business impact
Ability of application design to evolve
Delivering value to our users as regularly as possible
Limiting defects
Ability to mitigate problems
In doing so, you will collaborate with the rest of the team to find the most appropriate methodologies and organization modes.

By joining Wakam, you'll also be joining a community of practice for software engineers. As part of our values and principles of sharing and continuous improvement, passing on and exchanging experiences is part of our routine.

 

✯ Profile required
- You have at least 8 years of experience in information systems design.

- Knowledge of the .NET ecosystem is a plus. That said, your ability to write code that is understandable and maintainable over time will be much more important to us.

- Have you ever worked with cloud-provisioned environments? Great! Azure ? Perfect. Building, deploying and operating systems agnostic to their environment is like second nature to you? Even better.

- For you, flexibility and simplicity prevail on a daily basis.

- By working in a context that encourages collaboration as much as possible, you're comfortable asking questions and passing on your ideas. If, by chance, the activity of optimizing a value chain is as entertaining for you as a board game, we'll appreciate it.

Wakam aspires to be international and open to remote working. As software engineers, we also believe that effective communication is a key factor in the success of our organizations. Speaking English and French (professional level) is a prerequisite. We also encourage collective intelligence and collaborative decision-making. Being available at similar times to the rest of the team is also a prerequisite. The maximum time difference must be 2 hours.

        <title>Partnerships Auditor/Auditeur.trice Partenariats</title>
        <id>4175791101</id>
        <description>
✎ Mission
Le modèle de Wakam nous amène à externaliser de nombreux processus clés pour un assureur : souscription, production, gestion des sinistres.
 
Nous contrôlons nos partenaires sur ces différents aspects à travers 3 leviers : le contrôle continu opérationnel, l’analyse technique et l’audit. Wakam considère que l’audit est une activité cœur, qui dépasse largement le cadre requis par le régulateur. Nous auditons chaque année l’intégralité de nos partenaires, en nous focalisant non seulement sur les activités standards, mais également en gardant toujours à l’esprit les questions suivantes : « le partenaire offre-t-il la meilleure qualité de service pour nos clients ? Quel risque réel représente-t-il pour nous ? ».
 
Afin de répondre à ces questions, Wakam se livre à 3 grandes activités d’audit sur l’ensemble de ses partenaires :
 
Une Due Diligence, très en amont de nos discussions avec un prospect, dont l’objectif est de nous assurer qu’il est suffisamment fiable & robuste pour travailler avec Wakam
Un Préaudit, juste avant la mise en production d’un partenaire, dont l’objectif est de rentrer plus en détails sur ses processus et de contrôler son processus de souscription pour les clients finaux
Un Audit annuel, dont l’objectif est de contrôler le fonctionnement du partenaire et d’auditer un échantillon de ses dossiers Wakam pour nous assurer que la gestion y est faite selon nos standards les plus élevés, dans le respect des besoins et dans l’intérêt du client final
Day-to-day:
Rattaché(-e) à la Responsable d'audit des partenaires, vous aurez notamment des missions suivantes :
 
Participation à la planification et organisation des campagnes d’audit
Participation aux ateliers de préparation des audits et de restitution des résultats avec les équipes de Wakam et ceux des partenaires
Réalisation des audits : vérification de la conformité, identification des anomalies, identification des pistes d’amélioration et des recommandations & Rédaction des rapports d’audit
Enregistrement des constats et recommandations post audit dans les outils
Suivi des plans d’actions et de clôture des recommandations des partenariats
Participation à la gouvernance de la mission d’audit
Réalisation des Due Diligences des nouveaux partenaires
Réalisation des pré-audits et des rapports de pré-audit
Contribution à l’amélioration de la méthodologie et des outils de due diligence, de pré-audit et d’audit
✯ Profil
Vous êtes diplômé d'un BAC+5 avec une spécialité audit, finance ou assurance/Juriste
Vous justifiez d’une expérience réussie d’au moins 4/5 ans en audit/contrôle interne dans une compagnie d’assurance ou dans un cabinet de conseil ou d’audit
Vous parlez obligatoirement couramment anglais, une 3e langue européenne maitrisée est un plus
Votre working mindset:
