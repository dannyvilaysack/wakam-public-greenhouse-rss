        <id>4175791101</id>
        <description>
✎ Mission
Le modèle de Wakam nous amène à externaliser de nombreux processus clés pour un assureur : souscription, production, gestion des sinistres.
 
Nous contrôlons nos partenaires sur ces différents aspects à travers 3 leviers : le contrôle continu opérationnel, l’analyse technique et l’audit. Wakam considère que l’audit est une activité cœur, qui dépasse largement le cadre requis par le régulateur. Nous auditons chaque année l’intégralité de nos partenaires, en nous focalisant non seulement sur les activités standards, mais également en gardant toujours à l’esprit les questions suivantes : « le partenaire offre-t-il la meilleure qualité de service pour nos clients ? Quel risque réel représente-t-il pour nous ? ».
 
Afin de répondre à ces questions, Wakam se livre à 3 grandes activités d’audit sur l’ensemble de ses partenaires :
 
Une Due Diligence, très en amont de nos discussions avec un prospect, dont l’objectif est de nous assurer qu’il est suffisamment fiable & robuste pour travailler avec Wakam
Un Préaudit, juste avant la mise en production d’un partenaire, dont l’objectif est de rentrer plus en détails sur ses processus et de contrôler son processus de souscription pour les clients finaux
Un Audit annuel, dont l’objectif est de contrôler le fonctionnement du partenaire et d’auditer un échantillon de ses dossiers Wakam pour nous assurer que la gestion y est faite selon nos standards les plus élevés, dans le respect des besoins et dans l’intérêt du client final
Day-to-day:
Rattaché(-e) à la Responsable d'audit des partenaires, vous aurez notamment des missions suivantes :
 
Participation à la planification et organisation des campagnes d’audit
Participation aux ateliers de préparation des audits et de restitution des résultats avec les équipes de Wakam et ceux des partenaires
Réalisation des audits : vérification de la conformité, identification des anomalies, identification des pistes d’amélioration et des recommandations & Rédaction des rapports d’audit
Enregistrement des constats et recommandations post audit dans les outils
Suivi des plans d’actions et de clôture des recommandations des partenariats
Participation à la gouvernance de la mission d’audit
Réalisation des Due Diligences des nouveaux partenaires
Réalisation des pré-audits et des rapports de pré-audit
Contribution à l’amélioration de la méthodologie et des outils de due diligence, de pré-audit et d’audit
✯ Profil
Vous êtes diplômé d'un BAC+5 avec une spécialité audit, finance ou assurance/Juriste
Vous justifiez d’une expérience réussie d’au moins 4/5 ans en audit/contrôle interne dans une compagnie d’assurance ou dans un cabinet de conseil ou d’audit
Vous parlez obligatoirement couramment anglais, une 3e langue européenne maitrisée est un plus
Votre working mindset:
 
Vous êtes dynamique, réactif.ve et vous performez dans des environnements exigeants et cadencés
Vous êtes reconnu.e pour votre rigueur, votre autonomie ainsi que vos capacités d'analyse, de synthèse et de rédaction
Vous adaptez rapidement votre effort et gérez parfaitement les priorités

With a flat hierarchical system and a highly collaborative operating model, Wakam is an extremely agile and transparent company.
Every last Friday of the month, it's Free.day at Wakam, a day without meetings to take a step aside and dedicate ourselves to skills sponsorship or other activities (because we are curious, I remind you).
Full-remote is a reality at Wakam (there is even one Wakamee who works from his sailing boat ⛵)
Last but not least : we are nice and we have fun! (you'll find out by yourself 😉)
